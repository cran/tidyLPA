\description{
This simulated dataset, based on Crochetti et al., 2014, contains five annual
assessments of adolescents' mean scores on the commitment, exploration (in
depth), and reconsideration subscales of the Utrecht-Management of Identity
Commitments Scale (Crocetti et al., 2008). The scores reported here reflect
the educational identity subscales of this instrument. The first measurement
wave occurred when adolescents were, on
average, 14 years old, and the last one when they were 18 years old.
